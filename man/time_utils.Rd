\description{
Internal functions for consistent timezone handling throughout
the pvflux package. All solar position calculations are performed in UTC
to ensure consistency, with timestamps converted back to their original
timezone in the output.
}
\details{
The pvflux package follows these timezone conventions:
\itemize{
\item Input timestamps are converted to POSIXct if not already
\item If no timezone is specified, UTC is assumed
\item All internal calculations use UTC time
\item Output timestamps are returned in the original input timezone
}

This approach ensures that solar position calculations are always performed
consistently regardless of the input timezone, while preserving the user's
preferred time representation in the output.
