\description{
Converts global horizontal irradiance (GHI) to plane-of-array (POA)
irradiance using the Olmo et al. (1999) clearness index method.

Unlike traditional transposition models that require decomposition of GHI into
direct and diffuse components, this model uses the clearness index to directly
estimate POA irradiance. Following Ayvazoğluyüksel & Başaran Filik (2018),
the model is implemented as:
\deqn{I_{\gamma} = I \cdot \psi_o \cdot F_c}
where:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{\psi_o = \exp\left(-k_t\left(\left(\frac{\pi\theta}{180}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\pi\theta_z}{180}\right)^2\right)\right)} is the conversion function
\item \eqn{F_c = 1 + \rho \sin^2(\theta/2)} is the ground reflection multiplying factor
}

Note: This implementation uses angles in radians for the calculation, which is
mathematically equivalent to the paper's formulation using angles in degrees.

\section{Warning}{

The Olmo model was developed and calibrated using data from Granada, Spain
(37.18°N, 3.61°W). Validation studies at other locations have shown significant
errors:
\itemize{
\item Ruiz et al. (2002) found RMSE of 21.5\% on south-facing surfaces and
52.2\% on north-facing surfaces in Madrid
\item Evseev & Kudish (2009) found the model "generally overestimated" radiation
at Beer Sheva, Israel
\item RMSE increases with panel tilt (from ~8\% at 12° to ~30\% at higher tilts)
}

For most applications, especially outside southern Spain, the
\code{\link{haydavies_transposition}} model with \code{\link{erbs_decomposition}}
is recommended instead, as it provides more reliable estimates across diverse
locations and conditions.
